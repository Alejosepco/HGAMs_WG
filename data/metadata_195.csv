Prior to the start of each season. participants receivea packet containing a route map. data collection sheets. and instructions detailing the followingstandardized methods:? The survey begins one-half hour before local sunrise.? Survey stops are located no closer than a half mile apart along routes and remain in the same locationfrom year to year to maintain consistency.? The observer visits each of a route?s 50 stops in sequence and. during the three-minute stationarycount period. counts all birds heard or seen within a quarter mile. Birds seen before or afterthe three-minute count period. or while traveling between stops. are not counted.? Only a single observer collects the data. although assistants may serve as data recorders and drivers.? Pishing. tape playbacks. and other methods of coaxing responses from birds are not allowed.? Each survey is conducted once annually during the peak of the breeding season; most surveys areconducted during June. although surveys in desert areas and some southern states are conductedduring May. Observers try to conduct the surveys as near as possible to previous survey dates.? Each survey is normally completed in 4?4.5 hours. not including driving time to and from the route.? Surveys are conducted only during suitable weather conditions; precipitation and high winds areavoided because these conditions reduce the likelihood of detecting birds along the route.

The process was:
The years 1978-2007 were used. All routes that were marked as a ""high quality run"" (passed BBS screens for weather, correct dates, and observer quality) in each of those 30 years was retained. This resulted in 440 routes.
